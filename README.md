## 1. Check if your audio device is detected
Run the following command:
```bash
pactl list short sinks
```
If your audio devices are detected correctly, you should see entries similar to:
```bash
408	alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo	PipeWire	s32le 2ch 48000Hz	IDLE
439	alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo	PipeWire	s32le 2ch 48000Hz	RUNNING
```
However, if you see something like this:
```bash
33 auto_null PipeWire float32le 2ch 48000Hz SUSPENDED
``` 
it means your audio device was not detected properly, and PipeWire is falling back to a dummy (null) output instead of a real audio device.


## 2. Edit ALSA’s modprobe configuration file
### 2.1 Edit ALSA Configuration
Run the following command to open ALSA’s configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
```
This file is used to pass options to kernel sound modules (drivers) when they are loaded.
Add the following line to the file:
```bash
options snd-hda-intel model=auto
```
* On a desktop, model=auto is usually the best choice.
* On a laptop, you may need a specific model. Refer to the [link](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/sound/hd-audio/models.html).

Common values include:
* auto → Let ALSA guess (default, usually best for modern kernels).
* thinkpad → For ThinkPad laptops.
* dell-headset-multi → For Dell laptops with combo jack.
* asus → For ASUS laptops.
* hp → For HP laptops.

### 2.2 Apply the changes
Reload ALSA:
```bash
sudo alsa force-reload
```
Restart PipeWire and WirePlumber:
```bash
systemctl --user restart pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber
```

### 2.3 Verify audio devices
Check available sinks:
```bash
pactl list short sinks
```
You should see real devices, for example:
```
alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo
alsa_output.pci-0000_01_00.1.hdmi-stereo
```
however, if you are still not seeing your audio device or only see auto_null,
then your audio device was not detected correctly, and the issue may be with the driver rather than the configuration.
